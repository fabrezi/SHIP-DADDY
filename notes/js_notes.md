## JS

JS is a language that has taken over the web browser and mobile app market. I don't know of a site that doesn't support JS.

From Backend desgin, I learned about the difference between `module` and `module.exports`. This is based on different design formats, such as: ES6, CJS, ESM, UMD etc. NodeJS follows CJS while the JS standard in ES6.

NodeJS is the parent software to ExpressJS. Express is the minimal framework for Nodes (my favorite for obvious reasons). It gives alot of the power to the user. So things as security must be handled indiviually. Express is similar to Flask in many ways.
